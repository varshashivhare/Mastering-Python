**Master the art of writing beautiful and powerful Python by using all of the features that Python 3.5 offers**

## What is this book about?
Python is a dynamic programming language. It is known for its high readability and hence it is often the first language learned by new programmers. Python being multi-paradigm, it can be used to achieve the same thing in different ways and it is compatible across different platforms. Even if you find writing Python code easy, writing code that is efficient, easy to maintain, and reuse is not so straightforward.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create a virtualenv and start a new project 
* Understand how and when to use the functional programming paradigm 
* Get familiar with the different ways the decorators can be written in 
* Understand the power of generators and coroutines without digressing into lambda calculus 
* Create metaclasses and how it makes working with Python far easier 
* Generate HTML documentation out of documents and code using Sphinx 
* Learn how to track and optimize application performance, both memory and cpu 
* Use the multiprocessing library, not just locally but also across multiple machines 
* Get a basic understanding of packaging and creating your own libraries/applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import abc
import importlib
class Plugins(abc.ABCMeta):
 plugins = dict()
 def __new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace):
 cls = abc.ABCMeta.__new__(
 metaclass, name, bases, namespace)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Almost anyone can learn to write working script and create high quality code but they might lack a structured understanding of what it means to be 'Pythonic'. If you are a Python programmer who wants to code efficiently by getting the syntax and usage of a few intricate Python techniques exactly right, this book is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-15 | Python 3.3+, Python 3.5 recommended | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
